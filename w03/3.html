            <span>JavaScript</span> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
            <br>As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
            <br>All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
            <br><br>
            JavaScript is a <span><u>high-level, often just-in-time compiled language</u></span> that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
            <br>It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
            <br>It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
            <br>It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
